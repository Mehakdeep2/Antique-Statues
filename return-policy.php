				<h4>COVID-19 UPDATE</h4>
     <br/>
				<p>We're back! AE and Aerie stores are now open and offering free In-Store and Curbside Pickup, plus returns and exchanges. Find a store to see if a location is near you. We also want you to know that things will be a little different from what you're used to at the stores, as we're taking extra care to keep you and our associates safe. Learn More
 
We will continue to provide refunds on digital orders for mailed returns. We cannot accept exchanges by mail at this time. You can place a new order for an updated item, and separately mail the return back to us. Start a Return
 

You can wait as long as you need to return your items – there is no time limit to provide a full refund, charge back to a credit card, make an exchange, or issue an AE Gift Card. </p>
<br/>
				<h4>Return + Exchange Policy</h4>
     <br/>
				<p>If you're not completely happy with a purchase, just return it for a full refund. Returns with proof of purchase (receipt, invoice, order confirmation page, order details page, order emails) will be refunded in the manner in which the original purchase was made. If you don't have proof of purchase, we'll let you exchange or give you store credit for the current price. 

If you are charged more than the posted or advertised price, we will refund the difference. If there appears to be a fraud or abuse, we may not return your item. 
 
If you buy a swimsuit or bikini bottom & remove the hygienic liner, we will no longer be able to accept the return.</p>
<br/>
				<h4>In-store returns + exchanges </h4>
     <br/>
				<p>Bring your items to any AE, Aerie, or Tailgate store in the U.S. for easy, free returns and exchanges. 

Bring proof of purchase (receipt, invoice, order confirmation page, order details page, order emails) and the credit card used to make the original purchase.

If you don't have proof of purchase, you'll be credited the current price of the item in the form of an AE gift card.

If the items were shipped to you, please note that shipping is not refundable.

To find the closest store, use our store locator.</p>
<br/>
				<h4>Returns + exchanges by mail</h4><br/>
				<p>If you ordered items online or through the AE Live app, you can also ship your items back to us. If possible, reuse the original packaging to send them back.
 
We cannot accept exchanges by mail at this time. You can place a new order for an updated item, and separately mail the return back to us.
Through our online portal, you can indicate which items you’d like to return and print your shipping label to send your items back.
If your order qualified for free returns, you can use this label to mail your items back at no additional cost.
If your order did not qualify for free returns, you can still get a label to mail your items back. A $5 fee will be deducted from your refund to cover shipping costs.
